      <h1>Preparation</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>The chosen interface is a vending machine in the lobby of the library.</li>
        <li>There are several interview questions I designed which 
          I have saved for the observations section.
        </li>
        <li>Pictured: a rough sketch of the vending machine's functions

      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="observations">
      <h1>Observations</h1>
      <p>Some of the interesting observations I made are listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some people swipe their credit card first. Perhaps they don't care about price?</li>
        <li>In order to get two items, one has to make two separate payments.</li>
        <li>Other users went straight for the buttons to check the price of items.</li>
        <li>One user had trouble for the payment to go through. 
          This user clicked buttons and tapped credit card several times before item was deposited</li>
        <li>Users who clicked numbers first to check prices had to tap their card 
          and then click the numbers again to get their product. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I also devised several questions to ask users about their own experiences. Here are the results:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Given the layout of the machine, what would you do first?
          <ul>
            <li>Look for the desired item first, asking the question "what do I want?"</li>
            <li>Tap card on the credit card machine</li>
            <li>Insert numbers to check price of desired items</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How would you go about looking for the price of items?
          <ul>
            <li>Insert the numbers corresponding to the item I want</li>
            <li>Some vending machines have physical price tags listed below the items, 
              so some users are used to looking at the item first.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How do you pay for the item? 
          <ul>
            <li>Tap my card on the credit card reader and select the item</li>
            <li>Select item and then tap credit card on the reader</li>
            <li>Most users seemed to not carry cash — no one used cash to pay.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Is it clear to you how you would use the machine?
          <ul>
            <li>Some users felt that it was confusing that the prices weren't listed directly.</li>
            <li>Some said it was moderately clear: the credit card reader 
              has a very small display that says "swipe or tap to begin."</li>
            <li>Others felt there was an initial adjustment process because they were
               used to using other types of vending machines.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>What are some frustrations you have with the machine?
          <ul>
            <li>Price-conscious users felt that not having prices directly listed was frustrating</li>
            <li>Others felt that it's never very clear whether one should pay first or select item first.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>What do you like about the interface?
          <ul>
            <li>Shorter users can get snacks from the top row without having to reach it by themselves.</li>
            <li>Item numbers are clearly listed.</li>
            <li>Buttons for selecting items are easy to press.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In what situations would you use this?
          <ul>For a snack: a little hungry but no time to go to a restaurant.</ul>
          <ul>Busy, in a rush.</ul>
          <ul>Studying late night at the library.</ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div id="header">
        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <p>These personas are meant to represent two types of people that commonly use the vending machine I observed.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="personas-container">
        <div id="studying">
          <img class="persona-map" src="./assets/Empathy-Tony.jpg" alt="map of Tony">
          <p>Tony is price-conscious, and one of the problem he faces is trying to figure out the prices of the items. He wants the interface to more visibly display the price so that he doesn't have to spend so much time inputting numbers. 
            He also wants something that is a late night snack but also gives him enough energy to finish his assignments. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="rushed">
          <img class="persona-map" src="./assets/Empathy-Ken.jpg" alt="map of Ken">
          <p>The biggest challenge Ken faces is time — he needs the interface to be as intuitive and fast as possible so he can get a snack before class. Ken is a good subset of users of this interface. Many users use vending machines for their convenience, especially if they are time crunched. He is also one of those people who does not slow down to check the prices because he is in a rush. </p>
